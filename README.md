# About me
Many years of working in the sales and purchasing departments have taught me a lot about the basics of business. However, I became interested in manual testing and programming and decided to take testing and front-end courses. I am constantly investing in my development and I am ready for increasingly difficult challenges to achieve my goal of working in the IT industry.
